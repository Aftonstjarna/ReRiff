# ReRiff 1.2.4-beta.2 — Linux runtime and menu testing

## In-game summary

- Linux setup and updates now include their own Python runtime.
- Download and manage an optional Linux server from the launcher.
- Settings confirmations preserve scrolled graphics-menu rows.

## Full release notes

Experimental client test build for Windows and Linux/Proton. Stable 1.2.3
remains the default download and update channel.

### Linux setup and optional local server

- Bundle Python and helper libraries in an AnyLinux AppImage for installation
  and updates. System Python and package layering are no longer required.
- Offer a separate, checksum-verified local-server AppImage through the launcher.
  Linux users can install, start and stop it without Podman. Windows retains
  its existing Podman integration.
- Start an installed Linux server with Play when its localhost address is
  configured. Stop servers started by that launch after the game closes;
  leave previously running servers alone.
- Use `http://127.0.0.1:5144` in Secondary server for the default local server.
  Primary is tried first. Preserve local data and reuse existing launcher-managed
  Podman data and its configured port when migrating.
- Write local-server diagnostics under the game's `logs/` folder. Verify process
  ownership before stopping a server; keep unrelated listeners and processes
  untouched.
- Include the runtime in Linux update preparation and installer rollback checks.
  The server download is optional and remains separate from the client installer.

### Launcher updates

- Use standard edit borders for server and timeout fields under Wine, avoiding
  the extra themed focus outline while retaining text editing and Tab navigation.
- Select experimental releases by GitHub publication time. Stable updates use
  GitHub Latest; release metadata supplies the package version and installer.
- Handle escaped release tags, pagination and channel changes while retaining
  checksum and package checks. Skip matching versions unless changing channels
  or requesting a test reinstall.

### Menus and documentation

- Preserve the graphics-menu scroll viewport while native confirmation dialogs
  own input. Hidden slider rows stay hidden and underlying controls stay inactive.
- Audit native selector, slider, Apply and save-prompt integration against local
  decomp findings; add a regression for confirmation-time row visibility.
- Simplify the README and clarify installation, update channels and Linux setup.
- Record controller-input and remapping research. This build adds no controller
  remapping or acceleration changes.

### Validation and testing

- Local checks cover installer safety, update preparation, native menu navigation,
  UI scale, save prompts, display handling and optional-server lifecycle.
- The Linux AppImages passed tests without host Python, Podman or FUSE, including
  an isolated Alpine container and a Wine launcher handoff.
- Test the complete client on Windows and Linux/Proton. SteamOS/Bazzite and NixOS
  desktop integration still need real-machine testing. Graphics and confirmation
  behavior still need an in-game retest.
- This release does not publish or deploy the separate experimental server branch.

# ReRiff 1.2.4-beta.1 — Display and input testing

## In-game summary

- Test corrected windowed clicks and fullscreen mode selection.
- Save prompts keep input focus while settings stay inactive.
- High-rate FLAC analysis uses the original 44.1 kHz resampler.

## Full release notes

Experimental test build. Display transitions, Alt-Tab, confirmation controls
and windowed pointer alignment need in-game testing on Linux and Windows.
Server ID/migration support is published separately in the experimental Docker
image; updating the client does not update an existing Docker server.

- Restore the selected windowed client dimensions when leaving borderless.
- Map absolute windowed pointer coordinates to the actual render dimensions;
  retain native relative and normalized input paths.
- Remove overlapping fullscreen-label directional activation shortcuts.
- Keep added settings controls and scrolling inactive beneath native overlays.
- Normalize native activation messages and release capture on deactivation.
- Publish persistent server IDs and remember alternate server addresses.
- Add an explicit, backed-up one-time LAN-to-public file-link migration.
- Highlight each fullscreen arrow individually and keep its hitbox separate.
- Resample non-44.1 kHz FLAC analysis PCM with the original Ogg resampler.
  Source audio/playback remain unchanged; regenerate affected cached tracks.
